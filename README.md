# Are you looking for a Data Analyst or related roles?

Hi, I am Sophie. I am a data analyst with a great curiosity for the human psyche and behavior, complex patterns, and surprising relationships that allow me to draw a story from rows, columns, and variables. From my background in psychological research, I am experienced in finding meaning within complex data sets. I fine-tuned my skills in data analytics to universalize my toolset for industry requirements. When deep-diving into data, I am profitng from my analytical, divergent, and creative thinking style. During my PhD, I could train myself to persistently work towards a goal, via self-organization, task prioritizing, and seeking efficient ways of problem-solving. My therapeutical background allows me to enrich a team with solution orientation, critical thinking, communicative skills, and a deep interest in others' perspectives. My goal is to help targeting the treatment gap in psychotherapy and to provide future-oriented companies with data-driven insights to support their business strategies.

Here you can find my most recent experiences, qualifications, skills, and other information.
I am looking for a junior position as a data analyst or related roles.
